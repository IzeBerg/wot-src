"\"My friend, they called you a bear not because you were big and strong, but because you snore louder than the rest of the barracks. Whenever you fell asleep in the tank, we couldn't hear the engine. I got used to it pretty quickly, but our sergeants were ready to sell their souls for a pair of earplugs.\n"
"By the way, what are you doing this winter? Going into hibernation, or do you have some other plans? Sorry, I had to. You gotta understand, this Mirny makes even me a little nervous. They say it's a research operation, but all the residents were evacuated long ago. It's not hard to see that something went sour down there. And why am I not surprised that I'll be the first to go there? Then again, who else? Anyway, here goes. This isn't our first time getting into the thick of it.\n"
"Well, good luck, Douglas. I hope to see you soon. I'll bring you some honey on the way back.\""

"Hey, don't get sad right away. I told you, I have a great team with an experienced commander. The vehicle is fitted with the best equipment, and it's prepared for anything. But most importantly, I feel like I can finally do something important in this life, write my name in history, and play my part in making our world so much better.\n"
"Now do you understand why I signed up for this? Well, then wish me luck, little sister, and tell me everything's going to be alright.\""

"Hope has been talking about the research prospects and scientific discoveries all day long, while the mechanics have been loading the tank with everything they can find in the warehouse. Suspicious. Lining, docking portal, radio detector, gun camera... What can I say, the more the better. I don't know if it'll be any use on the other side of the perimeter, but I like that I'll be able to deploy a mobile laboratory if necessary.\n"
"Sadly, so far there are more questions than answers, but, to be fair, that really creates extra scientific interest. Why were civilians evacuated in such a hurry? What kind of substance is Mirium? Did they tell us everything?..\n"
"Hope gave me a poster as a gift, and I hung it in the tank. I want to believe that we really are looking for the key to a brighter future. Of course, I understand that it might be extremely dangerous, but the chance to be a pioneer comes once in a lifetime. I'm ready to take that risk."

"An all-season style created as a reminder of the very first operation in "

"The objectives of the first operation to clarify the circumstances of the rift have not been achieved. The location of the group has not been determined. Presumably, they're still in the town. Battle groups continue to be sent to Mirny-13.\n"
"Prior to his disappearance, Commander Focht managed to report information about the unknown properties of Mirium. The substance in its activated state was found by other commanders who were sent to the town. Lead researcher Hope is currently studying it. Work has begun to search for additional samples, because the specialist notes that the matter is very valuable and that all available resources should be used for its extraction.\n"
"Sounds of fighting in the town and messages of an unknown nature are transmitted by the radio every day. At present, there is no possibility of deciphering and identifying them. One unintelligible message was also received with a report on the first operation. Due to heavy interference, it was impossible to decipher anything. It was likely sent by the first group."
