"So how are you? Have you come 'round? You'll see the medics later. Every gun counts now. The assault has already begun. And because we were late, the enemy's focused all their attention on another flank. This is our chance. We attack pronto. Break into town and squeeze them from both sides.\n"
"Follow us—and avoid the dragon's teeth. They've got a bunch of rows of those concrete fangs in that field. But that's okay. We'll come through. All you gotta do is listen to me and execute my orders quickly and precisely. MacLeod and I will cover you.\n"
