"\"Hello, Dad. I hope you and Mom are doing well and don't miss me much. Things are looking up for me! I think I'll be promoted for the success of Operation Husky, just like you wanted. You should see the beast I command: a captured Japanese tank, as huge and reliable as a sledgehammer. Before our landing, our engineers reworked it so well, even you'd be surprised.\n"
"We're on the mainland now, moving north—though not too fast. But we'll get through it! We have no other choice. I've also made two friends: a bold French girl named Colette and a guy with a complicated fate named Stefan. They're great guys, but you might not say so at first glance.\n"
"In all other respects, things are the same. As they say, a front line is a front line.\n"
"Sincerely, your son Ian.\n"

"\"Do you remember, Yanka, how we volunteered for the Army? You signed up as Andrzej and didn't respond to this name for the first couple of days. I didn't think we'd be sent to the South—it's too far from home. Well, Africa's no resort, but we're not timid—we did it!\n"
"Looks to me we'll have a hard time in Italy, too, but who's going to ask us?\n"
"My only dream is to come back to my homeland and build a house when this is all over. A small one by the river. To live a normal life—although it seems it'll never be normal again… All right, everything will be fine. We'll take a steam bath, and that grandma will treat us to smalec. Be careful and come back soon, and I'll take care of that famed Duplex Drive system. The landing is serious business, so I'll be working here 'til morning.\""

"An all-season style inspired by the Byzantine mosaic that Harman first saw "
"in one of the liberated island's abbeys. The striking lines and colors "
"impressed the perfectionist so much that all he could talk about all day was"

"work of art."

"An all-season style reminding us of the time Bugeaud separated from the "
"group in a strike of fury, started chasing an enemy column by herself, and "
"got into an ambush. Even though her allies were there just in time, "

"An all-season style calling back to the time when Adaškevič went on a "
"morning fishing trip after liberating the island. An antenna from a captured"

"swordfish was caught that day, but the six mullets made for a nice broth."

"The operation was supposed to start at noon, and we were fully prepared for a decisive attack. Intelligence reported that the enemy planned to exit the town, which would lead them straight into the line of fire of the allied tank battalion in the coastal area.\n"
"It would be the understatement of the year to say that absolutely nothing went according to plan. Harman may think he's the smartest person in the room, but I still can't explain why he rushed forward the moment he noticed the first of their vehicles. It's obvious that they were anticipating an ambush, so they reacted right away.\n"
"And Bugeaud is no better. She's uncontrollable. Not only does she pretend to know English, but she also thinks she can take on a column of armored vehicles. She should be thanking us for saving her life, but no: \"I never agreed to anything with you. Leave your complaints with the others.\" Quite the woman.\n"
"At the end of the day, the command's orders are fulfilled, but no thanks to us. We failed. After this, we could be anything—just not a team."

"The three-day march was planned to the minute. It had to take place secretly so that Harman's, Bugeaud's, and Adaškevič's vehicles would be an unpleasant surprise for the enemy during the first attack. By this time, the group could already be considered coherent: They had gone through many battles, discovering each other's strengths and dealing with their weaknesses...\n"
"The first strike was taken by Harman. A shell from an anti-tank self-propelled gun miraculously failed to penetrate the armor, although it knocked out the Australian's vehicle. A rain of fire came down from all sides. Retreating and covering each other, they drove several hundred meters, and Adaškevič finally found positions that would give them a chance to survive until dawn...\n"
"...The captured Type 5 Heavy held the main wave of fire and even managed to shoot down several enemy vehicles that got in the way with one shot each. The T57 Heavy Tank attacked from the right flank, and the fates of the three crews who had not noticed it were sealed. But Bugeaud was retreating—the damaged ammo rack and broken observation devices made it clear that it could be over for her at any second. She left the defense of her left flank and fell back under the clang of her comrades' armor. However, Adaškevič did not hurry to retreat. It was true madness to leave the village and enter open space, but something told him that the fight was not over...\n"
"They stood together, waiting for the thunder. Ian was signing the last armor-piercing shell. Stefan was humming \"Red Poppies\" quietly. Six heavy tanks were moving toward them at full speed, and the enemy was rushing to get their trophies...\n"
"The sun appeared on the horizon four minutes later. And along with it, the silhouette of the French AMX 50 Foch B flashed behind the backs of the enemy. Colette chose precisely the right place and time, and her tank destroyer was ready to attack."

"A series of four major battles was their last joint operation. By that time, Bugeaud, Adaškevič, and Harman knew that only together could they pass through the fires of combat and the waters of the Mediterranean.\n"

"He does not look like a hard-boiled commander. He does not need glory, "
