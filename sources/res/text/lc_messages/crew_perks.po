"The standard range of potential damage and potential penetration value is ±25%. For example, if the shell penetrates 100 mm of armor and causes 100 HP of damage, on impact, it will penetrate 75–125 mm of armor and cause 75–125 HP of damage. Reducing this modifier leads to more predictable shot results."
