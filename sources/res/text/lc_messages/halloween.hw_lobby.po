"\"Impulsive, carefree, and prone to rash decisions.\" That's the description the Rector of the Grimmhildt Magic Academy chose to include in Sybill's personal file. In fact, it was the most neutral feedback she could find, despite everything the teaching staff had written about the young witch over her years as a student. Outside of her personal file, she's been described as \"reckless,\" \"hot-tempered,\" and \"explosive.\" However, these qualities later came in handy when Sybill entered the tank forces.\n"

"The sudden discovery of a magical gift can be a ticket to a new life... or a real curse. It all depends on the person who discovers it. Aurelia, the daughter of esteemed Count von Alden, hid her powers for as long as she could. But in the end, her parents had no choice but to send her to a magical academy.\n"

"After graduating, Aurelia von Alden suddenly found herself loading ammo in the crew of the legendary magical tank, Hammer.\n"

"Cordelia placed the bundle of food that the villagers had given her against the tree roots and got to work. Over the week since the crash, she had been able to retrieve almost half of the debris from the swamp.\n"
"\n"
"The witch looked over the parts laying in the clearing and let out a deep sigh. She was absolutely certain that the tank was irreparable.\n"
"\n"
"Nevertheless, a commander cannot just wallow in despair. Cordelia stepped up to the edge of the swamp and focused. The wreckage was gradually sinking into the sticky mud, which had initially granted the tank a fairly soft landing. Another day or two, and there would have been no hope of retrieving it. But now...\n"
"\n"
"She used her powers to probe her surroundings, and eventually bumped into some kind of object. Cordelia carefully wrapped her energy around it and pulled. Soon, a piece of sludge-covered debris emerged from the depths of the swamp.\n"

"Got it! This was exactly what she needed: a radio.\n"

"Sybill had taken an instant liking to this new world. It didn't have any foolish rules, and she could use her fire powers whenever she pleased. Better yet, it seemed that everyone here liked to party, and that suited her just fine.\n"
"\n"
"The witch sipped her cocktail and pulled out her wand, sending another firework bursting into the sky. The crowd cheered at first, but soon, their glee was replaced by confusion. Sybill glanced up. Shocked, she rubbed her eyes and looked again.\n"
"\n"
"The fiery twirls of the fireworks had formed words. And those words had formed a sentence, urging Sybill to see Cordelia. In short, the party was ruined.\n"
"\n"
"\"I think it's time to wrap things up,\" Sybill muttered. \"Otherwise, Cordy might show up here herself.\"\n"
"\n"
"At that very moment, two things happened at once: the music stopped and several tanks came bursting out of the woods. One of them looked around with its turret, then fired into the air.\n"
"\n"
"\"Party crashers, huh?\" Sybill set down her cocktail and cracked her knuckles. The witch's hands were wrapped in crimson flames."

"Aurelia von Alden turned her page with a slight flick of the wrist and continued to read.\n"
"The library had enveloped her in a feeling of quiet and comfort that she had sorely missed while serving in the armored forces. Especially the quiet.\n"
"\n"
"Suddenly, the sound of a bell rang out. Aurelia frowned. It seemed that it was time for a class break. And that meant her peace and quiet had come to an end. About two minutes later, the doors to the reading room flew open, and her first visitors appeared. Aurelia finished her tea, delicately set the cup on the desk, and got to work.\n"

"\"Wonderful, Dei. Remarkable, Dei.\" The witch turned the bent suspension arm around in her hand, then tossed it into the corner.\n"
"\"The suspension can't handle a magical boost, and the rubber rollers didn't help. So, what should we try next?\"\n"
"\n"
"\"The spider chassis wasn't fast or load-bearing enough, and there isn't enough magic in this world to build a flying chassis. These normal tanks just can't handle the boost. Even enhancing the suspension with magic didn't work. Either the principles of magical acceleration are different here, or...\n"
"Or it's only good for making toys.\"\n"
"\n"
"The witch sighed. She caught sight of the cookie box, and reached towards it reflexively, almost as if her hand had a mind of its own.\n"
"A week had passed, and she still could not assemble a working magic tank. And her friends were out there somewhere, waiting for her help.\n"

"I was created to protect my crew, and for many years, it took everything in my power to do just that. Now I consider my duty fulfilled.\n"

"My body crumbled in this unfamiliar world, but I received a new one in its stead. Of course, it's not without drawbacks: these mortal fleas are quite annoying, but at least I can scratch myself now. And I'd say the witches need my help. They'll never manage on their own. Surely, they can't get back home without me.\n"
"\n"
"Caudamius adjusted his belt and smiled into his whiskers. Yes, one last mission.\n"

"He approached one of the witches. She was too focused on fiddling with her radio to pay any attention to the cat, same as usual. Caudamius struck a heroic pose and cleared his throat:\n"

"The cat had been circling the witch's feet for quite some time, but Cordelia still had no idea where he had come from. The beast was clearly interested in what the witch was doing. At times, he lifted himself to his hind legs and carefully examined the radio parts lying on the tree stump. It seemed to Cordelia that he desperately wanted to offer some kind of advice on its assembly.\n"
"\n"
"''You know, I've never had a familiar,\" she said. \"I always considered it a relic of the past. But maybe it's time to get one of my own. Will you be my familiar, hm?\"\n"

"The cat looked at Cordelia gravely and snorted.\n"
"\"Well, no means no,\" she shrugged. \"Do you want to be my radio operator, then?\"\n"

"The cat reached for the switch with his paw and flipped it, then stared up at Cordelia with a wide grin.\n"
"\"You're right, it's time for some action. Everything's finally ready,\" she said.\n"

"\"Come on guys, calm down,\" she patted the tank on its still-warm armor. \"I'm going. But this was fun, wasn't it?\"\n"
"The tank hiccuped, but appeared to stop shivering.\n"
"\n"
"Sybill picked up her backpack and glanced around. Yes, they seemed to have gotten a little... carried away. How upset Cordelia would have been to see such a mess. The edge of the forest was a very picturesque sight. Sure, that's how it always looked at the end of a party, but now it was no longer Sybill's job to clean it up.\n"
"\n"
"\"You guys can handle this, right?\" she asked a tank.\n"
"The answer was silence; tanks can't talk, after all. Sybill approached the vehicle and knocked on an armor plate.\n"
"\"I don't have to stick around and do everything myself, do I? You're going to clean it all up, right?\"\n"
"The tank hiccuped again and seemed to nod with its turret.\n"

However, you can't just bury yourself in...\" she scanned the neat rows of bookshelves, trying to choose her words carefully. \"In books.\"\n"
"\"But I didn't sign up for this,\" Aurelia tried again.\n"
"\"Oh, that you did.\" The headmistress waved the contract in front of the witch and pointed theatrically to the signature at the bottom.\n"
"\"But I...\"\n"
"\"No 'buts,' Miss von Alden. Your class will be expecting you tomorrow at 8 A.M. sharp in Room 13.\"\n"

"Suddenly, the radio on the far table sprang to life, emitting a loud ringing noise. The device hissed, coughed, and extended a long wiry arm with a quill. The witch barely managed to shove a scrap of parchment under the device before it began to scribble a message in sprawling handwriting... Cordelia's handwriting! Under a few quick sentences, Deirdre recognized the coordinates to a meeting point.\n"

"\"Hooray!\" Deirdre picked up the parchment and danced around the workshop with it. \"I've found them!\"\n"

"The witches studied him intensely. Sybill smacked her gum. \"Partly, yes.\" Cordelia broke the silence. \"I have no trouble believing that you opened the portal and dragged us into this mess. After all, cats are selfish, narcissistic creatures. What I find harder to believe is that a magical tank could transform into a cat, just like that. So, tell me, what made you come back to us?\n"
"\n"
"\"Did you get bored?\" Sybill suggested, but Cordelia quickly shushed her.\n"
"The cat continued fiddling with his helmet, gathering his thoughts.\n"
"\"I was made for war,\" he answered finally. \"It was all I knew. And I was tired of it. I thought it would be okay to skip a few battles, but I was wrong. I nearly lost the most important thing in life: the people around me. My friends. Will you f-forgive me?..\"\n"
