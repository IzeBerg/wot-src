"An option for developing light tank projects with versatile armament "
"including double-barreled autoloading guns. The vehicle was designed for a "
"scope of tasks that was as broad as possible. It was both a fast, "
"maneuverable scout and a support tank capable of flanking and firing from "
"its rapid guns. An overhead weapon station with easy maintenance access and "
"interchangeable cradles for mounting guns of different calibers made it "
"possible to keep the vehicle's weight low while ensuring the required "
"defense capabilities and a high degree of gun elevation/depression. By the "
"time the blueprints were completed, the Vz. 71 was no longer required by the"
" military. The scouting vehicle niche had already been filled by other "
"machines, and vehicle armoring had notably improved. A light vehicle without"
" missile armament thus became irrelevant."
