"January 1943, and it became the first Italian vehicle to be partially "
"welded. The serial model, designated Semovente da 105/25 M43, received a 25 "

" on September 8, 1943, 30 vehicles had already been manufactured and sent to"

"Germans, who set up and continued production. Between 1943 and 1944, 121 "

"After the Germans first adopted the use of StuG III assault guns with closed"
" cabins in 1940, the Italians started working on their own vehicle of a "
"similar type. As a basis for their design, they used the chassis of the "
"Carro Armato M 13/40 medium tank. The first prototype of the "
"Semovente da 75/18 was completed in February 1941. Instead of a turret and "
"turret platform, this vehicle featured a closed stationary cabin with a "
"mounted 75 mm Obice da 75/18 modello 34 howitzer. The vehicle armament was "
"sufficient for both providing fire support and fighting against most tanks "
"at the time. Its 50 mm frontal armor could, in theory, withstand most common"
" British two-pounder tank and anti-tank guns from long and medium ranges. "
"Most of the Semovente M41 da 75/18s that fought were lost in North Africa, "
"while others were captured by the Germans in the fall of 1943."

"At the end of 1940, the Italian Army encountered the British "

"interested in the concept of a high-speed tank. Initially, the plan was to "
"create a low vehicle with a maximum armor thickness of 30 mm, a maximum "
"weight of 13 tons, and armaments typical for Italian vehicles. Its 250 h.p. "
"engine was supposed to provide a top speed of 55 km/h. The tank's weight and"
" length gradually increased, and, as a result, it was a low-silhouette "
"vehicle with a height of 2 meters. However, the vehicle did not pass full-"
