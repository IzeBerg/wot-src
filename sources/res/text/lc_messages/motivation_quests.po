"Heavy tanks have powerful guns and sturdy frontal armor that is hard to "
"penetrate. However, this advantage is balanced by their poor "
"maneuverability, which makes it easy to flank them and hit weak spots in the"

"One way to win a battle is to capture the enemy base. When enemy tanks are "
"focused on fierce fighting, you can slip past them unnoticed and take the "
"base. Remember that the more vehicles holding position within the base "
"circle, the faster the capture. The maximum capture speed is achieved with 3"
" vehicles in the base circle."
