"\"Another report on excessive shell usage? Anything else? You, asino stupido, got your shoulder marks two weeks ago but already managed to get everyone sick of useless paperwork. I always dreamed of writing reports when going off to the front, of course. You wait there, Englishmen, hold on with your advance—I have a couple of papers to fill out. You are interested in ammunition and I am interested in where the 15th Infantry Brigade went. The one you promised would support us. Any ideas? Maybe you can write me a report? Quinctilius Varus, give me back my legions! Oh, what am I saying? You never even learned your country's history. Want to learn about excessive shell usage? We're firing them! At the enemy!
