"...The truth is that the vehicles in the bunker were not particularly reliable. And that's impossible under these conditions. But this is my life's work, and I won't let some \"warriors\" take my most precious thing away from me. If only they knew the sacrifices I had to make to get my hands on a new blueprint or drawing… How many sleepless nights I spent searching for the perfect balance between dynamics and defense… It's terrible to remember what I had to do to get the parts I needed…\n"
"These rust buckets they came in are pathetic excuses for combat vehicles—garbage! Although… I do have to admit some of their technical solutions were decent. But they'll stay in the sands forever!\n"
"What concerns me most is this Holmberg woman. She knows something. An ordinary spy can't bypass the second security level. Yes, it's possible, but not that fast! And this cunning Italian guy always manages to avoid my cameras. Never mind—they're heading to their graves with remarkable speed. The main room is booby-trapped. All I have to do is wait. By the time they figure out where they are, it'll be too late…"

"…Just listen to what she writes: \"I'd like to enroll due to my desire to work with Sandro Mancini.\" I don't believe a single word she says. She's never been in any organization longer than two months. She's a fraud. Or maybe a spy?\n"
"That's okay, but now check out what our insane translator says: \"My dream is to go to the desert and find a legendary scroll that will be a breakthrough in studying ancient languages.\" He's got nothing better to do back home?\n"
"All right, I saved the best for last—our Mr. Betcha: \"We have information from Headquarters that participation in this operation will bring rewards, so…\"\n"
