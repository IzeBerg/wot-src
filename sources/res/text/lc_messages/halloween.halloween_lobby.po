We'll do everything that depends on us to make sure the professor has enough time and strength to finish his job. We'll go down to any phase. We can find anything at all there, we can blow it all up or drag it up here. Just as long as all this isn't in vain.\n"

The destruction was minor, but a chain reaction began that affected all the matter stock in their research facility. As a result, all Mirium within a significant radius was deactivated and lost its qualities. Their scientists couldn't open new rifts at the complex anymore.\n"
"\n"
"They decided to abandon their bomb development in favor of a new priority direction—the use of Mirium subspace for transportation. According to the documents, they planned to build an entire network of transit bases in that subspace, called Dark Towers. Throughout Europe and beyond. Imagine, you build bases in lower phases, build up your forces and vehicles there. And then you open the path and strike where the enemy isn't expecting you at all. Behind the frontline or in their capital cities. The Blitzkrieg strategy, perfected.\n"

"Fortunately, they weren't able to do it. They didn't manage to develop an \"exit technology\". They needed a beacon. An anchor.\n"

"This is a dangerous idea, I get it. But if I'm right... We might have a chance to not only hold back the echo tanks' invasion, but to stop them once and for all. To eliminate the very threat of Mirium.\n"
"\n"
"If everything goes according to plan, we may soon leave this whole nightmare behind. And it wouldn't just be because of our own work, but also because of our enemy. Our former enemy."

"You know, doc, I've been thinking a lot about this echo tank invasion since we last spoke. And the more I think, the more I'm convinced it's not just an accident or a side effect of our raids. There's something bigger behind this, for sure.\n"
"\n"
"You saw the records, you know how they act. Their actions are very precise, targeted. As if someone's controlling them. But who? Or what?\n"
"\n"
"Maybe the matter itself is a sentient being that protects its territory? Sounds crazy, right? But after what I've seen... I don't know, doc.\n"
"\n"
"I'm sure the answers are there, in the deepest phase. And the deeper we go, the closer we are to unraveling this mystery. We're about to get it!\n"
"\n"
"But are we ready for what we might discover there? Hell, I don't even know if I'm ready myself...\n"
"\n"
"You know, doc, sometimes it feels like we should just stop. Like we should just blow everything to pieces here, destroy all the records, and forget about each other. You know? We forget about Mirium and it forgets about us. Before it's too late.\n"
"\n"
"Maybe when I become completely certain of that, that's when I'll no longer be fit to serve as a commander...\n"
"\n"
"It's alright, doc. I'm alright, I won't let any of my guys down. Stamp this, it's time for me to get back to the rift. Everything's gonna be tip-top."

"Report on Intercepted Messages\n"
"\n"
"Our counterintelligence unit has intercepted encrypted messages.\n"
"\n"
"Cryptanalysts have identified the encryption method: it is a modified version of the Enigma cipher, which was widely used by the German military during World War II.\n"
"\n"
"Our experts have concluded that these messages are addressed somewhere to the depths of subspace or were transmitted through it. We have not yet been able to completely track their route, but the very fact that such communication occurred raises serious concerns.\n"
"\n"
"Currently, the contents of the messages remain unknown. Our specialists are working to decipher them, but modifications made to the original Enigma code complicate the process significantly.\n"
"\n"
"Preliminary conclusions:\n"
"\n"
"The use of the Enigma cipher and the direction of the messages suggest that there is an information leak and an enemy agent inside the Babylon Research Center.\n"
"\n"
"Given the critical nature of our work and the potential consequences of being compromised, I recommend that a thorough internal investigation be initiated immediately. Everyone at the Center, including senior management and key researchers, must be vetted.\n"
"\n"
"I request additional resources and personnel to conduct an internal investigation and continue decryption efforts."

"The first time they broke into our world, they managed to catch us off guard.\n"
"\n"
"I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of wailing alarms, red warning lights were lit up everywhere, and the speakers were mumbling something about an emergency. Within two minutes I was in my tank, and in three my platoon was moving out to position.\n"
"\n"
"Echo tanks. Here, in our world. I wasn't even that surprised back then. It was bound to happen one day. The strange thing was that they weren't aggressive—they looked disoriented.\n"
"\n"
"But the enemy came round quickly and opened fire. No one was going to negotiate with them anyway. We have experienced tank crews, so we dealt with the first group quickly. But then they started coming in waves. New breakthrough coordinates: first, second, third... Dispatch couldn't keep up with them, and we were running around the entire complex like crazy till morning, when the reinforcements arrived.\n"
"\n"
"Back then, during battle, I didn't have time either to feel anything or to comprehend what was going on. I was doing everything automatically, like a mechanical dummy. Only later, when I was sitting in the barracks and trying to write a report, did I suddenly realize what had happened. We'd opened Pandora's box. We opened it, and now we might not be able to close it. Things will only get worse from here..."

"It's complete chaos over there! More and more rifts are appearing, the echo tanks aren't letting up in their advance, and you're distracting me from my work! Have you seen what's happening in the phases? No? Let me tell you. It's hell over there! And while you're here playing your stupid games, that hell is getting ever closer!\n"
"\n"
"And what's this nonsense about intercepting a signal? Do you even understand how comms work inside the anomaly? There are always interference, reflections, echoes over the radio. Tankers are reporting strange sounds every day, they say they're hearing some girl's voice or some other nonsense. So, you're going to take every rustle as an indication of spy activity?\n"
"\n"
"It's a real genius idea you've got here: instead of focusing on the real threat, let's go on a witch hunt against our own people! That'll definitely help us deal with what's going on outside!\n"
"\n"
"You know what? I'm not going to spend any more of my time on this. I've got work to do. And if you think about the future even a little, you'll let me get on with it while you focus on protecting Babylon. Because if we don't stop this insanity, even the most elusive spies won't matter."

"Usually, echo tanks just crumble to pieces after they're destroyed. But this one didn't. It was standing there with its engine compartment blown up and smoking, just like a real one.\n"
"\n"
"I don't know what made me approach it. It's forbidden, but... I did it, and opened its hatch.\n"
"\n"
"I woke up at the infirmary. I was told that none of it happened. That I didn't open the hatch or even make it to the wrecked tank. And that the tank took as long to vanish as they usually do.\n"
"\n"
"But I have a clear memory of looking inside the echo tank. I remember the person who was inside it. They were wearing a strange helmet with pipes. It wasn't just some Mirium goo—it was a human who could be captured and interrogated.\n"
"\n"
"They weren't moving or reacting to my attempts to free them. Only the bulbs inside the tank started blinking as if some system had activated.\n"
"\n"
"I was trying to pull that damn helmet off the tanker and calm them down: \"Don't resist, we'll pull you out, and this will all be over.\"\n"
"\n"
"After that, everything's hazy. There was some fog before my eyes and some voices in my head. A lot of voices speaking some strange language, almost like German, calling me or trying to warn me about something.\n"
"\n"
"And then the infirmary. The doctors say they barely brought me back. I was unconscious for almost a day.\n"
"\n"
"I can't still figure out what it was. Or whether it even happened at all. I probably just inhaled some matter due to depressurization, and was hallucinating: the tanker, the helmet, the voices...\n"

"The army doesn't see what this will lead to. Every new raid to the phases only provokes it, wakes it up. We're on the edge of the abyss, but they keep pushing us forward, blinded by their hunger for power!\n"

"I tried to explain and warn them again. They wouldn't listen. For them I'm just another scientist lost in his own theories. They don't see the threat that now looms over the whole of humanity.\n"

"\n"
"It's hard for them, they didn't expect this. They need several days to recover after their first battle. I'm just so used to it that I no longer even think about how abnormal it is when you take out an enemy tank and it just vanishes.\n"
"\n"
"But the core of the squad is growing. Some of the newbies are getting ahead of themselves, going charging into the next battle without having rested enough first. It's bad and it's dangerous, but there's no choice. We still don't have enough men.\n"
"\n"
"Actually, my only task should be expeditions. It's like the professor says: you need to fight the cause, not the symptoms. He hasn't been looking healthy recently, though. He's a nervous wreck. But that's understandable: he's probably not getting any sleep due to his work on a giant new collector—Magnus Prime.\n"
"\n"
"What if this is all because of it? Because of the collector? Maybe it's drawing echo tanks from the anomaly like a magnet?\n"
"\n"
"The enemy vehicles have changed, too. They looked disoriented at first. They don't anymore. Their attacks are precise, coherent. And the rifts have stopped opening chaotically. It all looks increasingly like a planned assault. As if they know where the weak spots in our defense are, and strike there. And very accurately at that. Like sentient beings. Or controlled ones.\n"
"\n"
"Okay, enough of this. I've noticed strange thoughts creeping into my head recently.\n"
