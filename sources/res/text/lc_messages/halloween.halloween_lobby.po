"Scientists have discovered an unknown matter in the closed research city of Mirny-13. The matter was called Mirium. It was activated by a nuclear explosion at a nearby training facility, which caused a series of gravitational anomalies. Civilians were evacuated, and all roads to the city were cordoned off.\n"
"\n"
"Multiple military squads arrived at the scene to investigate. They discovered a rift that took them to another dimension where they encountered unknown hostile tanks, including a huge vehicle codenamed the Immortal. Thanks to the findings of senior researcher H., the Immortal was destroyed, and the rift was closed.\n"
"\n"
"A few days later, another disaster followed. A new rift opened, and enemy vehicles came swarming through it. Senior researcher H. is believed to be the one to blame.\n"
"\n"
"A squad under the command of Captain Novak was deployed to the location to handle the emergency. He reported that H. had fled through the rift, so he was sent to search for her. Currently, all contact with the Captain is lost.\n"

"Fifteen minutes after another squad was dispatched, there was an outbreak of unidentified energy in the center of Mirny-13, accompanied by a flash of bright light. The accident disabled all equipment within a 10 km radius. The flash was visible from distant checkpoints. Due to repeated failed attempts to contact the commander who was in Mirny-13, squads were sent in to scout the place out.\n"
"\n"
"According to aerial footage, the city no longer exists—there is now a huge crater where it once was. Everyone who was in the perimeter is considered missing. There are currently no traces of Mirium activity and no evidence of new rifts being formed. The radius of the cordoned-off area has been increased to 40 km. The area is under constant surveillance.\n"

"The military brushed me off. They didn't want to understand. Mirium didn't attack us. It just wanted to go home. To go back to where it was extracted from. But the command kept on sending new tanks. Mirium was just copying them and creating reflections. The military was corrupting its nature, so it started corrupting the military. Even Novak couldn't withstand it. I should've stopped it.\n"

Judging by the remaining documents, it was under repair when the search operation began. That said, it's identical to Captain Novak's vehicle. This means that we have on our hands what became the basis for creating the monster inside the anomaly. I believe that we will be able to study the mechanism underlying this transformation. We will use Mirium to serve science and humanity.\n"
