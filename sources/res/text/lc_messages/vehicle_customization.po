In his mind, he can't believe the son of a Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons would prefer the Royal Armoured Corps over a political career. What hurts him the most was your deception about being enrolled at university and studying law when, in fact, you had joined the army with your mates. However, he did cool down a bit after he used his connections to find your commander. You can just imagine his expression when he heard you were considered one of the best tankers of all time. You might even say he was pleased with the news. Now he's rattling on about how even if he is the last politician in the family, you're going to start a military dynasty.

In fifteen years, we've made some solid progress, taking a giant leap from the stone age to a future that could only be found in the works of H.G. Wells. Right now, me and my boys have never felt as safe and sound as we do inside this steel beast. The enemy has no chance against this masterpiece of engineering.

We have the perfect gun, reliable armor, and it's so much better now after our field upgrades. This time, we'll be leading the attack. We'll be at the forefront of our army's glorious victory!

"It's a gloomy night, but the light of a single star still breaks through the clouds. The patrols' searchlights pierce the darkness every once in a while. Wandering back and forth isn't much fun, but it's better than waiting in the darkness with the others for orders to advance. The star in the sky seems to shine brighter all of a sudden. The atmosphere in the camp is oppressive. Everyone is scared, but nobody is showing it. All hope lies with the Sentinels. What they need to do now is quickly and, most importantly, secretly prepare their trump card in the battle against the Scourge—plasma cannons. Destructive, but very fragile weapons. The soft light seems to start flickering. Those over on the other side can't even imagine the consequences of such an attack. All we need is to get the right to strike first. After that, the enemy has no chance. Something has changed. The star. It was yellow, but now it's crimson. The target marker. All this time, they had been the target...\n"

Why do they give us American missile launchers? Why, Antonio? All their mounts are measured in inches. Were there really no equivalents of these missiles with metric mounts in all of Europe? Or was it another case of someone giving something to someone else, and here we have this beautiful American ATGM that we spent an entire day mounting and setting up with wrenches?! If only I knew how much of a pain it would be, I would have welded it to the turret and let it face and fire one way.

Back in the 2nd century BC, Cuju was played in ancient China, which—according to a FIFA representative—could be the oldest ancestor of the modern game of football. In Japan, a similar game called Kemari was played. You can watch matches of this game today in Shinto shrines during festivals. In North America, a football ancestor was called Pasuckuakohowog and was played on beaches. The field was 15 times longer than the modern one, the goal was half a mile wide, and up to 1,000 players could participate at a time.\n"

There is also a theory that Italians brought Calcio Fiorentino to the British Isles.

The way they worked is similar to today's way: Bookmakers would look for those who were willing to make bets, then they would pay out the winner and take a percentage of the bets for profit. Different countries have had laws forbidding or restricting betting for centuries, and governments would keep an eye on them.\n"
"In the mid-19th century, the governments of Great Britain, France, Germany, and some American states made betting legal. Bookmakers stopped working underground, and people's bets were protected by law. A huge boost to the industry happened in the '90s when the internet allowed for online betting. Currently, online sports betting is worth hundreds of billions of dollars, and tens of millions of people make those bets."
