"The development of the ARMT tank was based on the creation of an automated "
"loading mechanism that would provide a rate of fire previously considered "
"unattainable. This was made possible by the autoreloader, which delivered "
"quick-firing rounds driven by a planetary gear mechanism and an electric "
"motor. The innovative turret design allowed the gun to fire at an elevation "
"of about 60 degrees and a tilt angle of about -15 degrees. The removal of "
"the loader from the crew was also a tempting idea. In addition to the high "
"complexity of production and the difficulties in maintaining the "
"autoreloader, the tank was notable for its height and vulnerability. Its "
"75–76 mm gun was obsolete for fighting advanced Soviet tanks. At the same "
"time, attempts to mount a 90 mm gun would have resulted in a significant "
"increase in weight and a complete revision of the design, which was "
"ultimately never built."

"By the mid-1950s, the idea of turret-mounting a partially rotating gun had "

"feature was that the crew was located not in the turret, but in a cabin "
"behind it, which meant that the turret's dimensions could be reduced. "
"Loading was fully automated. The gunner would have aimed using cameras in "
"the turret, but a periscopic rotating reticle was also planned for the top "
"of the cabin. The commander's cupola would have been mounted with a remote-"
