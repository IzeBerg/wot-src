"A project of the self-taught engineer Rozanov. This fighting tank had thick,"
" angled armor plates, its suspension was protected by folding screens, and "
"the main feature was the addition of driven \"battle rollers\" in the front."
" They were supposed to protect its suspension from mines and shells and, if "
"needed, be raised up. Rozanov's other ideas included armored protection for "
"tank-borne infantry, as well as a shell delivery system involving a chain-"
"driven autoloader. The project was rejected by GABTU, as \"battle rollers\" "
"could not be used as a mine clearer in reality, and some other suggestions "
"were not sufficiently developed from an engineering standpoint."
